The steadily rising number of transistors on a chip increase the demand of generating functional units instead of designing everything manually. Therefore it is demonstated in this report how to fulfill this need for control and status register files. It is discussed why it is neccessary to generate such register files. The benefits and drawbacks of available generators are presented and especially the functionalities of the CAG Register File Generator are introduced.
